# My personal headache dashboard

I get headaches a lot. Part of the advice given in tackling a headache problem
is keeping a "headache journal", so to be able to pin down what exactly is
causing them.

I decided to follow this advice in the most quantified manner possible. As such
I've been collecting data on myself over the last couple of years so to see if
there are any statistical insights that can be extracted with regards to my
headaches.

This repository contains the code for producing a simple dashboard for
visualizing it, ideally online on my personal website, so that I can easily
share it with doctors.
